This is a new version of ScanBridge with multiple improvements and bug fixes:

* Deleting pages in scanning interface now requires confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
* Scanner support was improved, the HP Color Laserjet MFP M283fdw is now partially supported
* The scanned pages in the scanning interface sometimes overlapped other UI elements, this is now fixed
* URLs where the eSCL resource is at root level (e.g. http://192.168.178.11/) are now handled correctly
