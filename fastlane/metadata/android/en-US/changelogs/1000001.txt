This is a new version of ScanBridge with a couple of minor bug fixes:

* Fix stretching of scans in the PDF export if aspect ration doesn't match the expected one
* Fix crash when a scanner advertises an invalid address, ignore such scanners. If the address has a IPv6 scope ID strip it before using the address
