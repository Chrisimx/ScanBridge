To prevent crashes, ScanBridge limits the maximum count pages stored in one PDF file when exporting scanned pages as PDF. If there are too much pages, multiple PDFs are created and stored into a ZIP archive. These PDFs can be merged afterwards, if needed.\n\nWarning: Increasing this too far can lead to crashes while exporting if a large number of pages are to be exported.</string>
    <string name="disable_cert_checks">Disable certificate checks</string>
    <string name="disable_cert_checks_desc">This option disables all HTTPS certificate validation. Any certificate will be accepted, including self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid ones. Do not use this option on insecure or public networks, as it makes man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks possible.\n\nIn most cases, scanners are used on private networks or over VPN connections, where concerns about authenticity are minimal. In such environments, disabling certificate checks is unlikely to pose a real security risk. And in case confidentiality or authenticity is a concern, even HTTPS won\'t help much, as eSCL lacks client authentication altogether. Anyone with access to the network can potentially retrieve scanned pages.</string>
