Therefore, they remain in the app files.\n\nThis option automatically cleans these files up on every app start. However, this means that these scan files (which you might not have exported) get irreversibly deleted on every app start without asking you again. When this option is not checked (default) %1$s asks every time to confirm that you want to delete the scans and exports from the app files.</string>

These are files which remain in the app storage if the app is closed from the overview or killed by Android while being in a scanning session.
