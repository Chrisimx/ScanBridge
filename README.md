## ScanBridge: An easy to use android app for scanning documents

<b>ScanBridge</b> is a Material You app featuring scanning of documents, photos, and more over the
AirScan/eSCL protocol. The eSCL protocol allows for driverless usage of network scanners and is
supported by most modern
scanners.

It is written in Kotlin and uses Jetpack Compose.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png" alt="Discover scanners in your network" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" />
  <img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/2.png" alt="Scan multiple pages" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" />
  <img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/3.png" alt="Use your scanner to the maximum of its abilities" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" />
</div>

## Features

- Discover scanners supporting eSCL in your network
- Scan multiple pages and arrange them however you like
- Use your scanner to the maximum of its capabilities by adjusting settings like input source,
  resolution, duplex scan, scanning dimensions, and more
- Save your scans as PDF or images & directly share them with other apps
- Nice-looking Material You design
- Easy-to-use interface

## Permissions

eSCLKt only requires the internet permission to discover and use scanners in your network. No other
permissions are required.

## Dependencies

This project uses [eSCLKt](https://github.com/Chrisimx/eSCLKt), a Kotlin library for using
network-enabled
scanners supporting the eSCL/AirScan protocol.
Also, the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) library is used for the
UI.
Additionally, the [Telephoto](https://github.com/saket/telephoto) library is used for making the
scanned pages preview
zoomable.
All other dependencies are listed in the build.gradle files.

## Building

Gradle is used as the build system. To build an APK, run the following command:

```./gradlew assembleRelease```

Afterwards, sign it with apksigner, which is provided by the Android SDK:

```apksigner sign --ks path/to/keystore.jks --out path/to/signed.apk path/to/unsigned.apk```

If you just want to build and test ScanBridge run the following command:

```./gradlew build```

## Bugs & feature requests

You can ask questions, report bugs or submit feature requests on the GitHub issue tracker. Please
provide a detailed
description of the problem and if possible, a crash log, android logcats or stacktraces. In some
cases
the ScannerCapabilities.xml of your scanner can also be useful
